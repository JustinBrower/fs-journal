# Bootstrap
Bootstrap is a big library of snippets, classes, CSS code that you can pull from because devs are lazy

main takeaway right now is if you have bootstrap and want to do something specific, go to the website and see if they tell you

get bootstrap <link> from getbootstrap.com
order matters. Put Bootstrap link above your CSS link if you want CSS to take precedent

rows by default are d-flex boxes

"col-1" takes up 1 column in the row
12 columns is the default for bootstrap
if you go over 12, it'll wrap down to the next line of rows
dont give columns a number and itll share evenly

"btn" is how you call buttons in bootstrap
"p-1" means padding 1 unit of whatever bootstrap uses
px-1" is moving on the x axis, same for y

"a" tags take you to places. You can use this to have a button scroll to a part of the page, or a different website altogether

sticky-top makes things stick to the thing above it. same for everything else im sure

buttons are considered text themselves, so they can be manipulated/centered

img class="fluid" says make the image take up as much space as it can, but not more than its container

justify contents moves items along its MAIN axis, align items moves items along its SECONDARY axis
For rows, X is the main axis. Columns is Y.
