## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

Encapsulation has two purposes. To bundle data together and export it to where it's needed, and to protect that data from outside sources

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

New devs don't quite know what the underscore prefix is used for (hiding things from the user), so they may ignore them or just not use them.

3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

Everything in an ES6 class is private by default. You do this to hide information from the user.
