## Questions

1. What problem does using exports solve?

Without exports the programmer would have to rewrite code or functions in every .js they needed to be called in. Exports allows that all to funnel into one index

2. How does export differ from export default?

export default takes all values from the .js and exports them

3. What is a benefit of using the Module System?

Not having to rewrite code as well as having main .js files hidden from the user.
