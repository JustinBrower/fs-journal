## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

Pending
Resolved
Rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

We can attach callbacks rather than passing them

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

If functions pass, THEN something happens. If something fails, we need to CATCH it.
