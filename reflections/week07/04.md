## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

The pair coding thing was actually pretty useful and I'm glad I read that journal during the partner project. it ended up helping a lot knowing that you both need to be talking the whole time to make it effective.

2. What went well this week?

working with Haven was an absolute treat and our project is so far what I'm the most proud of making in this class.

3. What would you do differently?

I feel like I've done everything as intended this week and I don't think I'd change much.
I did the back-end for our project and I do wish that I showed Haven more of what I did so he could do well on this upcoming project.
But at the end of the day his education experience is his and I'm not responsible for it, but I feel communicating my work better is just a good skill to hone in the future.
