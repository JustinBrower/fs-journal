## Questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?

The UX is the user experience, which is everything that the user of your product can possibly interact with.
The main consideration should be what the user wants to do/know, not just what you want them to do/know.

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?

Obviously the whole reason products are made is for a user to use them. Taking into account the ux allows your team incorporate users' desires in meaninful ways.

3. Why is the User Experience important?

The UX being good or not could be the differance between your user purchasing something on your website/using your product and not, even though the product itself may not be different. The ux is all the user truly sees, which is a reflection of your product.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I'm not very good at styling (or css in general) but it's clearly just as important as the product itself. I think I should step away from the "I'm not very good at this" mentality and move towards a learning mentality. If I'm not good at css then that's what I should focus on.
