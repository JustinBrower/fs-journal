## Questions

1. What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value, Reference, Pointer.
Value types hold their values implicitly. Meaning the variable itself is the value.
Reference types instead hold the address of the value it's holding. Like having the deed to a house instead of always having the whole house on you.
Pointer types are separated from the others, and can't convert between other data types other than itself.

2. What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

Mostly everything except for strings is included in the value data type. I don't think JS differentiates between its data types unlike CS.

3. In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

I kind of addressed this in question one, but its like paying someone with a check instead of hard cash. You want to do this when you're paying a lot of money.
It would be difficult and annoying to carry around a large amount of cash everywhere, so instead we carry around representations of cash via checks that can be cashed in when needed.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I lost my repo for it but we did rock paper scissors in CS. It feels funny going back to simple projects after learning so much and making bigger apps. I always have fun optimizing small amounts of code and it was a good way to learn the basics of CS.
