## Questions

1. In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

Info in a row is like having one object with the properties that it has on it.
Info in a collumn is listing the objects that have that property.

2. Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called `characters` with the values `name, age, description` as strings, and an `int` id.

I copy and pasted a template from my project, but here it is.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id int AUTO_INCREMENT primary key,
  createdAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'Time Created',
  updatedAt DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP COMMENT 'Last Update',
  name varchar(255)
  age int
  description varchar(255)
) default charset utf8 COMMENT '';

3. What are the difference between the following statements: 
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
deleting stuff from a table
DROP TABLE table_name;
completely deleting the table itself
```

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

using tables is really useful when comparing to how node does data. Having everything listed for you in one area, and to be able to customize how you get that data sent to you is a great feature.
