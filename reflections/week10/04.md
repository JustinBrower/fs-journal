## Questions

1. What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

enums are representations of data that can be mapped to multiple other data sets. They're good to use because it's just representations of data, rather then actual data, so you can save space and maximizing efficiency.

2. How can you modify an Enum?

using switch and case will switch the data set and case is like an if statement that tells you when to use it.

3. How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I haven't used any yet, but I imagine you'd use them when you have multiple sets of data that you need to switch out quickly.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

I haven't used enums yet, but they seem like they're going to be an integral part to using csharp and having effecient data. I hope we use it for our final or review them more beforehand.
