> **ðŸ“– [C# List](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk10/02-List-Methods)**

## Questions

1. What is a List in C#?

A list is a method of storing like data. Very similar to arrays in JS.

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

Find, FindIndex, Range, Contains. We mainly want to find and manipulate data when it comes to lists, so I feel finding the data and adding/changing it will be used often.

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

The find method would be the first way I'd think of.
