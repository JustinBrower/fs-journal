## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`

A primary key is like the id that the object has that references itself. A foreign key is an id that is referenced from another object.
This is commonly used in many-to-manys where an object has an id from something else on it.

2. What is an `Alias`?

An alias is just a name for a table or varialbe that you've assigned to it.
An example would be instead of using like <GroupMemberViewModel> as a name for what you're referencing in your sql statement you could just assign it gmvm.

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  patientId
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)
I think this is what we want

string sql = @"
SELECT
d.*,
p.*
FROM patients p
JOIN doctors d ON d.id = p.doctorId
WHERE doctorId = @id
"
