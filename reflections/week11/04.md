## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

My main concern is getting stuck on one main part of the project that takes up my time, but if you've been listening to any teavher they'll tell you that TIME-BOXING is the biggest deal. Don't spend too much time on one failing postman test and just move on.
I plan on pounding the back-end until I either get stuck or just finish it up. Then move on to the front end, and when that's finished start working on the styling.

The thing I've enjoyed the most about the course is how fast-paced and focused it is. NO fluff at all and expecting students to keep up or sink is exactly what I wanted out of it. I'm really happy the expectations were set early to prepare me for the tough road ahead, because now that I'm nearing the end I'm feeling really good and proud of how I've done.

I've also enjoyed my classmates and the fun atmosphere overall. I don't joke when I say that joining codeworks was easily one of the best decisions I've made in my life.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

going through and making the entire app together was a really nice and helpful thing to do. Kinda put everything into perspective that this stuff isn't that difficult as long as you're paying attention and understand. it's not magic, it's math. as long as you follow the rules the language has it'll work.
