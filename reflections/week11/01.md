## Questions

1. What does Inheritance accomplish for us in C#?

Inheritance allows us to make base classes and apply those base classes to other classes that'll use those attributes.
Imagine you have properties that will go on every class in your app. Rather than writing that for each class you make, just make one class that holds those base attributes.

2. How does Member inheritance work in C#? Does a class inherit all members of the base class?

A class does NOT inherit all its members from the parent class. Constructors are one thing that are not inherited.

3. How does accessibility affect inheritance?

Only certain members are inherited directly. protected and private members are affected differently than public members.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment

inheritance is one of those things that helps devs do the more mundane things that have to be done over and over. having the ability to just add entire classes to other classes and conserve time is so important when you're working with large databases or using hundreds of classes.
