## Questions

1. What is Software Development Testing?

Simply put it's testing the software that's been developed. This can be done in multiple ways, but the most effective is by doing unit testing.
Unit testing trying to test the smallest unit of code at a time to make sure everything works as you go.

2. What are the benefits of Testing in software development?

Making sure each block of code works as you work will drastically reduce your time debugging. If you code small and test small, you'll catch those bugs quickly and maximize time spent working.

3. What are some potential drawbacks of Testing in software development?

Testing itself can take time from the project, and not all test are going to be completely accurate as some bugs will slip through, meaning that time spent testing was wasted. Overall though testing is extremely beneficial and is a must when coding.
