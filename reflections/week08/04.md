## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

Unit testing - testing one block of code at a time.
Component testing - making sure that a component is working properly by mounting it. Usually good to use the VUE tools with this method.
E2E testing - testing the ENTIRE application front to back. This way you cover all user experiences as a whole and how they function together.

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

personally I think unit testing is the best, because if EVERY block of code is functioning how it should then most of the time the whole thing will run as intended.

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I don't think any of them are NOT useful, but most likely E2E testing. It's good to KNOW that there are bugs in an area, but you won't know maybe on what component or code block.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

I actually didn't know there were names for testing other than unit testing. I don't often use the VUE tools but I think I'll start now if my error I'm getting is more broad.
