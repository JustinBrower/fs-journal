## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?

Making sure everyone is on the same page is key on a small team as one person might be handling projects on their own.
Nobody likes to edit or delete code because there was a misunderstanding.

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?

Broader communication in meetings to reduce number of meetings and maximizing team's time.
Choosing which methodology is important as well, but being flexible and switching between them will lead to the most success.

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?

Good, Fast, Cheap. Basically you can pick two out of the three for each method. The goal at the end of the day though is to get a good product out.
