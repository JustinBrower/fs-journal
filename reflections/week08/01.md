## Questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

helps hone your skills as well as shows employers/team members what you're capable of creating
it can be difficult developing a strong portfolio, so it's smart to keep it up as you go about your coding career

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

Simplicity in what you're trying to show for each skill/project. You don't want to overwhelm the person you're showing off to.
A wide range of skills to show off is also effective, but keeping one or two focused skills in their own project is what's best.

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

Mainly Tower and Network are good for showing off my VUE knowledge and ability to create and percieve data relationships.
I don't know what the final will be yet but if it's a fullstack application that'll be a very valuable addition to my portfolio as well.
