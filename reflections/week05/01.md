## Questions

1. What is the purpose of a Query String?

Allows you to pass information to and from a website by appending it to a url

2. What is the format of a query parameter? How does it start? How do you distinguish between one parameter and the next?

Query paramaters have their key and value, and separate query paramaters are separated by ampersands

3. When do you think Query parameters would be helpful when writing your server?

Sending info back and forth to your server in query methods rather than full urls each time will save so much time and space.
