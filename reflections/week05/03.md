## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

Only allowing a task to take up a certain amount of time to keep up effeciency.

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?

the 2 minute rule is important, breaking Parkinson's law, and setting a schedule

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

Okay I was working on the Task Manager checkpoint and it looked kinda ugly so I spent like an hour making it look good, just to realize that adding the quote at the bottom changes how I want it to look and had to redo it. Not to mention styling should be the LAST thing you do. Definitely a waste of my time and I learned from it.

I can already tell timeboxing is super underrated. This is probably the main difference between effecient devs and GODLIKE devs.
