## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

The most unique thing about our project is the relationships between the data. It's more complicated than anything we've done before.
This doesn't mean it's unfamiliar, just a bit more difficult

2. What went well so far?

Progress on the project is really good. We're quick with getting things done and working together.

3. What would you do differently? Why?

More clear communication. We've had some issues with not everyone being on the same page.
Sometimes it seems like the team all agrees on something but actually three of us have different ideas of what it is.
