## Questions

1. What is a Base64 Encoded Image?

An image that you've encoded straight into your HTML to try to save and load images better.

2. What are the drawbacks of using Base64 Encoding?

There's a few of them. Mainly that encoded images are a little bit bigger, your CPU has to decode them which makes the processer work harder, and caching issues.

3. Why are these drawbacks issues in this day and age versus in the past?

We have HTTP/2 nowadays making base64 encoding not as needed. You'd still want to use base64 encoding for some cases such as really small images.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's work

Reading about optimizing code right now is funny because that's what we're doing on our capstone right now. Trying to cut down the fat of what we've created to make a better experience overall. It's hard to tell the difference as a new dev how efficient your code is vs the better ways, but it's fun to practice.
