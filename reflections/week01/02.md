## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

A Pseudo-Class is a class that doesn't exist until called upon. A common one I believe I'll use is .i:hover. Where I want x to happen to i when hovered with the mouse.


2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is a system that allows order when multiple styles or tags are targeting the same element. This allows you to not have to specify every style to every element, and instead just organize them by class

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

!important overrides specificity, which could cause problems if you want to make a change to that class or div but !important won't let you. And if you set !important to an element early on in the project and want to change it you may find your specificity is bugged everywhere and this would create a lot of work.
