## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

Wire-framing helps you lay out your page and site before writing. This is much like making an outline to a research paper before you start writing without a purpose.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

Low, Mid, and High-fidelity wire-frames. Low is just the basic lines and boxes, mid is the interfaces and buttons to go with it, and high is the detail that'll be added at the end.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

If the website requires some complex design, ESPECIALLY on mobile, then yes. If it's just a simple website with a few boxes and lists, not worth it to wire-frame.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment.

While wire-framing is tedious, it's apart of the work. If I were ever making a website for a client, I would wire-frame it no matter how simple first to run it by the client first.
