## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

The tips on how different colors are used for different things, and how saving things like "red" for certain situations is important

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

Checking color schemes, shadows on boxes, borders, text color/size.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

Readability is the biggest one, as well as intuitive color design and interface. If things are hard to understand or digest visually then people will leave the site.
