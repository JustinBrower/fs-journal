# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?

I have no coding experience, unless you count making redstone traps in minecraft, so I was extremely nervous coming in. I'm happy to say that I have a good grasp on everything we've learned. And even if I don't fully understand it (aligning text, padding/margin, flex) I can figure it out pretty quick in a minute.

- What did you learn as a shock or suprise?

Honestly, how easy it was to do the basics. I feel as though I could make a genuine passable website after only 5 days of class.

- What are you struggling with?

Still strugling with mobile design, and just the basics of HTML structure and bootstrap and how to use it. I feel I'll keep learning as we go and my understanding as of now is sufficient.

- What would you count as a victory?

My Gnome website I made for this project is pretty sick and funny haha. But honestly my biggest victory is the friends I've made with my peers and instructors. I'm genuinely enjoying my company in class.
