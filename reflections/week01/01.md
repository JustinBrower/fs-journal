## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?
Developers are often working together on the same project, or multiple projects with the same code base. GIT allows the developers to revert back to versions of code and keep track of changes that other devs have made to better organize and debug the project.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?
Branches can be used to test code in a project without compromising or ruining the inital code. You can have a test branch to work on a parallel to the project and if it works, merge the master branch and test branch, and if it doesn't work the master branch is untainted by the massive amount of bugs you've created.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is a version control system that allows developers to work parallel to eachother on the same project while maintaing organized code.
Github is a website that allows you to "push" or upload your code to a repository that other devs or teammates can access.

Identify at least 1 takeaway from today's assignment
I don't fully understand how all of git or github works, but I do understand WHY it's here.
I also recognize that out of everything, this is the FIRST thing we're learning in class. It conveys to me the importance of knowing how to share code with your team (in this case, my teachers), and that if I don't know how to create/upload/share code I won't be successful at BCW or in career. Therefore I will make sure any questions I have will be answered tomorrow before we are expected to know it all first.
