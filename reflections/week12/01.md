# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

I actually got most of my project done over the weekend, mainly the backend and most of the front-end functionality, so I felt confident going in to today.

## Prompts
- How is today going? - I have most everything done! Mainly needing to style and fix some small bugs.
- Are you managing your stress? - My situation is a little unique where I'm leaving town on Thursday (hopefully) so I have one less day to finish, but I'm not worried yet.
- What has you most worried? The styling is difficult. I get everything else but aligning text end is still tough for me.
