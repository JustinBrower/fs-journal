# Daily Reflection
Two full days in! Did you make the progress you were hoping for yesterday and today? How are you working? Client -> Server, focusing only on the server for now?  
I'm pretty much for real finished now! Just need to finish up styling for real. I thought I had most everything done but small things always come up.

## Prompts
- How is today going? - Good. Getting stuck on a few things but the instructors are being helpful! I should be passing now so I'm good.
- Are you managing your stress? - I was getting stressed out today but slowly getting it all figured out. Just gotta remember things always work if you do it right.
- What has you most worried? - Just missing small styling issues.
