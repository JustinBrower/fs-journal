# Daily Reflection
Have you started the client? How is you vue application shaping up. Do you have the basics of data rendering to the page.  

PASSED! Super happy with everything and how it all turned out. I could have done a little bit better on styling but I did well on everything else!

## Prompts
- How is today going? Passed!
- Are you managing your stress? Really well, cause I passed!
- What has you most worried? How much pong I'm gonna play tomorrow!
